# Jules' Progress Log

This log tracks the development progress, insights, and actions performed by Jules (the AI software engineer).

## Phase: Initial Refactoring & Dexie Integration (Ongoing)

**Overall Goal:** Refactor a personal finance application to use Dexie.js for local-first data storage, enhance UI/UX consistency, and improve specific features like LLM integration and accessibility.

### Sub-Phase: Service Layer & Quality of Life Refinements (Current Focus)

**Objective:** Abstract data logic into dedicated services, refactor utilities for better organization, and address smaller code quality issues identified in previous phases.

**Date: July 10, 2025**

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  **Refactor `DataValidator` Service:**
    *   **Action:** Split the `DataValidator` class into two more focused utility files: `src/lib/format-utils.ts` (for display formatting) and `src/lib/validation-utils.ts` (for data validation).
    *   **Action:** Updated `VehicleList.tsx` and `income-tracker.tsx` to import `formatCurrency` from the new `format-utils.ts`.
    *   **Action:** Deleted the old `src/services/data-validator.ts` file.
    *   **Outcome:** Improved code organization and maintainability. Formatting and validation logic are now separated and can be imported individually.

2.  **Address `AdvancedExpenseOptions` `userId` Handling:**
    *   **Action:** Investigated the component and its dependency, `TagsInput.tsx`.
    *   **Action:** Refactored `TagsInput.tsx` to be robust against an `undefined` `userId`. It no longer defaults to `'default_user'` and will not perform user-specific DB operations if no user is provided.
    *   **Outcome:** This transitively fixes the issue in `AdvancedExpenseOptions`, preventing errors and incorrect behavior when a user is not logged in.

3.  **Implement `ExpenseService.ts` (Initial Draft):**
    *   **Action:** Created `src/services/ExpenseService.ts` with static methods for `addExpense`, `updateExpense`, `deleteExpense`, `getExpenses`, and `getExpenseById`.
    *   **Action:** Refactored the `EnhancedAddExpenseForm.tsx` component to use `ExpenseService.addExpense` instead of interacting with Dexie directly.
    *   **Outcome:** Successfully demonstrated the service layer pattern, abstracting database logic from the UI component. This sets a precedent for other data modules.

**Pending Tasks:**
*   Complete the implementation of `ExpenseService` by refactoring other components (e.g., expense list/tracker) to use the service for update and delete operations.
*   Create and implement similar services for other major data types (e.g., `VehicleService`, `AccountService`).
*   Update this progress log upon completion of the current plan.
