# Jules' Progress Log

This log tracks the development progress, insights, and actions performed by Jules (the AI software engineer).

## Phase: Initial Refactoring & Dexie Integration (Ongoing)

**Overall Goal:** Refactor a personal finance application to use Dexie.js for local-first data storage, enhance UI/UX consistency, and improve specific features like LLM integration and accessibility.

---

### Sub-Phase: Accessibility Review & Enhancements (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Improve the accessibility of various components by ensuring proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and clear labeling for assistive technologies.
**(Details omitted for brevity)**

---
### Sub-Phase: LLM API Optimization & Local LLM Setup (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Optimize the existing LLM API handling, add support for local LLM configuration, and ensure graceful degradation if LLM services are unavailable.
**(Details omitted for brevity)**

---
### Sub-Phase: Responsive Design Audit & Cross-Platform Enhancements (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Ensure the application is usable and looks good across various screen sizes, focusing on a mobile-first approach. Test on different desktop platforms.
**(Details omitted for brevity)**

### Sub-Phase: State Management Review (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Review and optimize Zustand store usage and IndexedDB indexing. Consider data synchronization hooks.

**Date: 2024-03-15** (Simulated Date)

**Tasks Completed (State Management):**

1.  **Review Zustand Store Usage (`useAppStore`) (Task 4.1 from main plan):**
    *   **Actions:** Reviewed `src/store/appStore.ts`.
    *   **Findings:** Store is well-structured for global state (unlock status, AI config). Persistence correctly handles sensitive data. Granular selectors are available for performance.
    *   **State:** Zustand store usage is good. No critical optimizations to the store definition identified.

2.  **Review IndexedDB Indexing (`db.ts`) (Task 4.2 from main plan):**
    *   **Actions:** Reviewed Dexie schema and index definitions in `src/db.ts`.
    *   **Findings:** Primary keys, `user_id` indexing, and indexing of commonly queried fields are generally robust and support efficient `useLiveQuery` operations.
    *   **State:** IndexedDB schema and indexing are well-suited for current needs. No immediate critical optimizations required.

3.  **Review Data Synchronization Hooks (Task 4.3 from main plan):**
    *   **Actions:** Assessed the current state of data synchronization between Dexie (local) and Supabase (cloud).
    *   **Findings:**
        *   A full, bi-directional, automatic synchronization system for all user data (expenses, accounts, etc.) is not currently implemented, aligning with the "local-first" primary focus.
        *   Supabase is used for authentication and for storing/syncing LLM configurations (a specific settings case).
        *   The existing Dexie schema (with `user_id` fields) provides a good foundation for potential future implementation of a comprehensive sync system.
    *   **Decision:** Implementing full data synchronization hooks is a major feature beyond the scope of this review task. No new generic sync hooks were added.
    *   **State:** The application remains primarily local-first for core financial data.

**Summary of Sub-Phase (State Management Review):**
The Zustand global store is well-implemented. Dexie.js indexing is appropriate for current query patterns. Full data synchronization for all user data entities is not currently in place and is a candidate for future feature development.
