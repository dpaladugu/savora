# Jules' Progress Log

This log tracks the development progress, insights, and actions performed by Jules (the AI software engineer).

## Phase: Initial Refactoring & Dexie Integration (Ongoing)

**Overall Goal:** Refactor a personal finance application to use Dexie.js for local-first data storage, enhance UI/UX consistency, abstract data logic into services, and improve specific features.

---

### Previously Completed Sub-Phases (Summary)

*   **Accessibility & UI:** Performed reviews and enhancements for accessibility, responsive design, and state management.
*   **Component Verification & Initial Cleanup:** Verified key components, enhanced the Tag Management system, laid conceptual groundwork for data services, and performed a broad scan to identify redundant code and differing implementations.
*   **Vehicle Module Refactor & User ID Implementation:** A major refactor to resolve critical TypeScript errors in the vehicle module, expand the vehicle data model in Dexie (schema v15), implement consistent `user_id` handling across all modules, correct the `incomes` table schema (v16), and integrate the `TagsInput` component.
*   **Service Layer Abstraction:** A major architectural refactoring that implemented the service layer pattern across the entire application for local data. This involved creating dedicated services for all major data types (Expenses, Vehicles, Accounts, etc.) and updating UI components to use these services instead of interacting with the database directly.
*   **Feature Enhancement & Final Cleanup:** Unified the redundant investment forms into a single Dexie-based workflow. Enhanced the main transaction tracker to display a unified list of incomes and expenses. Performed a final codebase cleanup to remove placeholders and debug logs.

### Sub-Phase: Finalizing Service Layer Abstraction (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Complete the service layer abstraction by creating a unified `TransactionService` and ensuring all components use this new abstraction.

**Date: July 10, 2025**

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  **Implement `TransactionService.ts`:**
    *   **Action:** Created `IncomeService.ts` to provide CRUD operations for income records.
    *   **Action:** Created `TransactionService.ts` which uses `ExpenseService` and `IncomeService` to provide unified methods like `getTransactions` and `deleteTransaction`.
    *   **Outcome:** This service now acts as a single point of entry for components that need to handle both expenses and incomes.

2.  **Refactor `expense-tracker.tsx` to Use `TransactionService`:**
    *   **Action:** Updated the `useLiveQuery` in `expense-tracker.tsx` to fetch a combined list of transactions directly from `TransactionService.getTransactions`.
    *   **Action:** Refactored the `handleDeleteTransaction` function to use `TransactionService.deleteTransaction`, which correctly delegates to the appropriate underlying service.
    *   **Outcome:** The main transaction tracker component is now fully decoupled from direct database logic for fetching and deleting combined transaction types, making it cleaner and more maintainable.

**Summary of Sub-Phase:**
This sub-phase successfully finalized the service layer abstraction for financial transactions. By creating and integrating `TransactionService`, the application now has a clean, unified, and robust pattern for managing mixed transaction data, completing the primary architectural goals of this refactoring effort.
