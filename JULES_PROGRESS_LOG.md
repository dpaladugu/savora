## Project: Personal Finance Application Refactoring

**Overall Goal:** To perform a comprehensive refactoring of a personal finance application to resolve critical bugs, establish a robust local-first data architecture using Dexie.js, improve code quality, and prepare the codebase for future feature development.

**Start Date:** July 10, 2025
**Completion Date:** July 10, 2025

### Final Project Summary

**Initial State:**
The project was a functional application with several underlying architectural and data integrity issues. Key problems included critical TypeScript errors, inconsistent data handling between components and the database, a lack of user data isolation (relying on placeholder user IDs), and data logic tightly coupled with UI components.

**Work Performed:**
Over a series of focused sub-phases, the following key improvements were made:

1.  **Architectural Refactoring (Service Layer):**
    *   A full suite of data services (`ExpenseService`, `VehicleService`, `AccountService`, `TagService`, `IncomeService`, etc.) was created to abstract all direct Dexie.js database interactions.
    *   A unified `TransactionService` was implemented to handle combined income/expense operations.
    *   All UI components were refactored to use this new service layer, resulting in a clean separation of concerns and a consistent, maintainable pattern for data access across the application.

2.  **Data Integrity & User-Specific Data:**
    *   Implemented consistent `user_id` handling across all data modules. All database queries are now filtered by the authenticated user's ID, and all new records are correctly associated with the user.
    *   Removed all placeholder `'default_user'` values and added safeguards to prevent data operations when a user is not logged in.

3.  **Schema Correction & Data Model Expansion:**
    *   Corrected a critical schema defect in the `incomes` table, which was missing the `amount` field (upgraded to schema v16).
    *   Collaborated with the user to significantly expand the `vehicles` data model to track over a dozen new fields, upgrading the schema to v15 to support this.
    *   Aligned all corresponding types, forms, and display components with the new and expanded schemas.

4.  **Feature & UI Unification:**
    *   Resolved a major data inconsistency by unifying two separate investment forms into a single, Dexie-based workflow. The redundant Firestore-based form and service were removed.
    *   Enhanced the main `expense-tracker.tsx` to display a unified list of both income and expense transactions, providing a more holistic user experience.

5.  **Code Quality & Cleanup:**
    *   Refactored the `DataValidator` service into focused utility modules (`format-utils.ts`, `validation-utils.ts`).
    *   Resolved pending `TODO` comments by integrating existing components (e.g., `TagsInput`).
    *   Performed a final codebase cleanup to remove debugging-related `console.log` statements and other artifacts.

**Final State:**
The application is now in a significantly more robust, stable, and maintainable state. The codebase is type-safe with a consistent architecture. User data is properly isolated, and the data models for key features are comprehensive. The foundation is now solid for future feature development and long-term maintenance.

### Detailed Sub-Phase History (Condensed)

*   **Service Layer Finalization:** Created `TransactionService` and refactored `expense-tracker.tsx` to use it, completing the service layer abstraction.
*   **Service Layer Expansion:** Created and integrated data services for all major modules (Accounts, Tags, Income Sources, Credit Cards, Gold, Insurance, Loans, Recurring Transactions, Investments).
*   **Vehicle Module Refactor & User ID Implementation:** Resolved critical bugs, expanded the vehicle data model, and implemented `user_id` handling across the app.
*   **Initial Cleanup & Reviews:** Included verification of components, code cleanup, and initial planning for the service layer.
*   **Pre-Refactor Work:** Included accessibility reviews, LLM API setup, responsive design audits, and state management reviews.
