# Jules' Progress Log

This log tracks the development progress, insights, and actions performed by Jules (the AI software engineer).

## Phase: Initial Refactoring & Dexie Integration (Ongoing)

**Overall Goal:** Refactor a personal finance application to use Dexie.js for local-first data storage, enhance UI/UX consistency, and improve specific features like LLM integration and accessibility.

### Sub-Phase: LLM API Optimization & Local LLM Setup (COMPLETED)
**(Details omitted for brevity)**

---
### Sub-Phase: Responsive Design Audit & Cross-Platform Enhancements (COMPLETED)
**(Details omitted for brevity)**

---
### Sub-Phase: State Management Review (COMPLETED)
**(Details omitted for brevity)**

---
### Sub-Phase: Component Verification & Service Layer Review (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Verify the functionality and completeness of key components/hooks and conduct a conceptual review for introducing dedicated data service layers.

**Date: 2024-03-15** (Simulated Date)

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  **Verify `useEnhancedExpenseValidation` Hook:** Reviewed, found functional and extensible. No changes made.
2.  **Verify Tag Management System (`TagManager.tsx`, `TagsInput.tsx`):** Reviewed. Enhanced `TagManager.tsx` for delete confirmation (checks tag usage) and improved form validation UX/accessibility. `TagsInput.tsx` confirmed robust.
3.  **Conceptual Review for Dedicated Data Services:** Completed. Recommendation is to implement dedicated data services to improve abstraction, testability, and maintainability.
4.  **Submit Changes:** Changes related to `TagManager.tsx` enhancements submitted.

**Summary of Sub-Phase:** Key hooks and components verified. `TagManager` enhanced. Conceptual groundwork laid for data services.

### Sub-Phase: Codebase Cleanup & Refactoring (Current Focus)

**Objective:** Reduce redundancy, consolidate similar components/services, and standardize approaches based on previous findings.

**Date: 2024-03-15** (Simulated Date)

**Tasks Completed (Cleanup & Refactoring):**

1.  **Scan for Redundant/Similar Files:**
    *   **Actions:** Performed a recursive file listing (`ls -R`) and analyzed the output. Read content of multiple files across expense management, dashboards, vehicle management, auth screens, data validators, and UI wrappers.
    *   **Findings:** Identified significant areas of potential redundancy and differing implementations for similar functionalities, particularly in:
        *   Expense Forms (multiple versions with different validation and features).
        *   Expense Trackers (multiple versions with different data strategies and UIs).
        *   Expense Validation (custom hook vs. Zod-based hook).
        *   Data Services for Expenses (Firestore-based vs. Supabase-based, and general Supabase service).
        *   Dashboard components (standard vs. "enhanced" versions).
        *   Vehicle Manager (filename casing variants).
        *   Auth Screens (standard vs. "enhanced").
        *   Error Boundaries (general vs. global vs. critical).
        *   Loading Wrappers (basic vs. enhanced vs. granular state components).
        *   Data Validators (utility class vs. Zod-based comprehensive validator).
    *   **State:** Scan complete. Detailed understanding of overlaps achieved.

**Pending Tasks (Cleanup & Refactoring):**
*   Task 2: Plan and Execute Cleanup/Refactoring (currently active).
    *   Sub-Task 2.1: Formulate Detailed Cleanup Sub-Plan.
    *   Sub-Task 2.2 onwards: Execute deletions, merges, and refactoring actions based on the sub-plan.
*   Task 3: Implement `ExpenseService.ts`.
*   Task 4: Implement `RecurringTransactionService.ts`.
*   Task 5: Update Progress Log & Submit.
