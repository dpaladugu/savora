# Jules' Progress Log

This log tracks the development progress, insights, and actions performed by Jules (the AI software engineer).

## Phase: Initial Refactoring & Dexie Integration (Ongoing)

**Overall Goal:** Refactor a personal finance application to use Dexie.js for local-first data storage, enhance UI/UX consistency, abstract data logic into services, and improve specific features.

---

### Previously Completed Sub-Phases (Summary)

*   **Accessibility & UI:** Performed reviews and enhancements for accessibility, responsive design, and state management.
*   **Component Verification & Initial Cleanup:** Verified key components, enhanced the Tag Management system, laid conceptual groundwork for data services, and performed a broad scan to identify redundant code and differing implementations.
*   **Vehicle Module Refactor & User ID Implementation:** A major refactor to resolve critical TypeScript errors in the vehicle module, expand the vehicle data model in Dexie (schema v15), implement consistent `user_id` handling across all modules, correct the `incomes` table schema (v16), and integrate the `TagsInput` component.

### Sub-Phase: Service Layer Abstraction (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Abstract all direct Dexie.js data logic from UI components into dedicated, reusable service classes to improve separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability.

**Date: July 10, 2025**

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  **Refactor `DataValidator` Service:**
    *   **Action:** Split the `DataValidator` class into `src/lib/format-utils.ts` (for display formatting) and `src/lib/validation-utils.ts` (for data validation). Updated components to use the new utilities and deleted the old service file.
    *   **Outcome:** Improved code organization.

2.  **Harden `TagsInput` Component:**
    *   **Action:** Refactored `TagsInput.tsx` to gracefully handle an `undefined` `userId`, which fixed a downstream issue in `AdvancedExpenseOptions`.
    *   **Outcome:** Component is now robust when no user is logged in.

3.  **Implement and Integrate Data Services:**
    *   **Action:** Created a suite of new service classes in `src/services/` for each major data entity (`ExpenseService`, `VehicleService`, `AccountService`, `TagService`, `IncomeSourceService`, `CreditCardService`, `GoldInvestmentService`, `InsuranceService`, `LoanService`, `RecurringTransactionService`, `InvestmentService`).
    *   **Action:** Each service was implemented with static methods for all CRUD operations (add, update, delete, get), encapsulating the direct `db.table` calls.
    *   **Action:** Refactored all corresponding manager components (e.g., `ExpenseTracker.tsx`, `VehicleManager.tsx`, `AccountManager.tsx`, etc.) to use the new service methods instead of interacting with Dexie directly.
    *   **Outcome:** The application's data access layer is now fully abstracted from the UI, leading to cleaner, more maintainable components and a consistent pattern for data handling.

4.  **Review Standalone Forms:**
    *   **Action:** Investigated `src/components/forms/add-investment-form.tsx` and its `InvestmentManager` service.
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed this form interacts directly with Firestore, not the local Dexie database, creating a data inconsistency with the Dexie-based `InvestmentsTracker.tsx`.
    *   **Outcome:** The investigation is complete. Unifying these two systems is a significant architectural task noted for future consideration.

5.  **Summarize `JULES_PROGRESS_LOG.md`:**
    *   **Action:** Condensed older log entries into a summary section to improve readability.

**Summary of Sub-Phase:**
This sub-phase successfully completed a major architectural refactoring by implementing the service layer pattern across the entire application for local data. This has greatly improved the separation of concerns and code organization.
