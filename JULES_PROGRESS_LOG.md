This log tracks the development progress, insights, and actions performed by Jules (the AI software engineer).

## Phase: Initial Refactoring & Dexie Integration (Ongoing)

**Overall Goal:** Refactor a personal finance application to use Dexie.js for local-first data storage, enhance UI/UX consistency, and improve specific features like LLM integration and accessibility.

### Sub-Phase: LLM API Optimization & Local LLM Setup (COMPLETED)

### Sub-Phase: Component Verification & Service Layer Review (Current Focus)

**Objective:** Verify the functionality and completeness of key components/hooks and conduct a conceptual review for introducing dedicated data service layers.

**Date: 2024-03-15** (Simulated Date)

**Tasks Completed (Component Verification & Service Layer Review):**

1.  **Verify `useEnhancedExpenseValidation` Hook (Task 1 of current plan sub-phase):**
    *   **Actions:** Reviewed `src/hooks/useEnhancedExpenseValidation.ts`.
    *   **Findings:** Hook is well-structured for current needs. Extensible for more field-specific validation rules. Cross-field/async validation are future considerations if needed.
    *   **State:** Verified as functional. No structural changes made.

2.  **Verify Tag Management System (`TagManager.tsx`, `TagsInput.tsx`) (Task 2 of current plan sub-phase):**
    *   **Actions:** Reviewed and enhanced `TagManager.tsx` (delete confirmation now checks tag usage, improved form validation UX and accessibility). `TagsInput.tsx` confirmed robust.
    *   **State:** Tag management system verified as comprehensive and user-friendly. Accessibility improved in `TagManager`.

3.  **Conceptual Review for Dedicated Data Services (Task 3 of current plan sub-phase):**
    *   **Actions:** Analyzed current direct Dexie usage in components vs. benefits of dedicated service layers (e.g., `ExpenseService`, `AccountService`).
    *   **Findings & Recommendation:**
        *   Current pattern: Direct Dexie usage in components/hooks.
        *   Pros of services: Abstraction, testability, maintainability, centralized logic, clearer data flow, better preparation for complex queries or backend sync.
        *   Cons: Potential boilerplate for simple CRUD.
        *   **Recommendation:** Proceed with creating dedicated data services, prioritizing those for more complex entities like Expenses and Recurring Transactions.
    *   **State:** Conceptual review complete. Decision is to recommend implementing data services. No code changes made *in this task* as it was a review.

**Pending Tasks (Component Verification & Service Layer Review):**
*   Task 4: Submit Changes (for work done in Task 1 & 2 of this sub-phase).
