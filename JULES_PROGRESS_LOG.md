# Jules' Progress Log

This log tracks the development progress, insights, and actions performed by Jules (the AI software engineer).

## Phase: Initial Refactoring & Dexie Integration (Ongoing)

**Overall Goal:** Refactor a personal finance application to use Dexie.js for local-first data storage, enhance UI/UX consistency, abstract data logic into services, and improve specific features.

---

### Previously Completed Sub-Phases (Summary)

*   **Accessibility & UI:** Performed reviews and enhancements for accessibility, responsive design, and state management.
*   **Component Verification & Initial Cleanup:** Verified key components, enhanced the Tag Management system, laid conceptual groundwork for data services, and performed a broad scan to identify redundant code and differing implementations.
*   **Vehicle Module Refactor & User ID Implementation:** A major refactor to resolve critical TypeScript errors in the vehicle module. This involved:
    *   Standardizing the Vehicle data type.
    *   Expanding the vehicle data model in Dexie (schema v15) and all related UI components (`AddVehicleForm`, `VehicleManager`, `VehicleList`) to support a comprehensive set of new fields.
    *   Implementing consistent `user_id` handling across all major data modules (Vehicles, Expenses, Incomes, Tags, Accounts, etc.) to ensure data isolation and integrity.
    *   Correcting the `incomes` table schema (v16) to include critical fields like `amount`.
    *   Integrating `TagsInput` into the `AddIncomeForm`.

### Sub-Phase: Service Layer Expansion & Code Quality (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Abstract data logic into dedicated services, refactor utilities for better organization, and address smaller code quality issues identified in previous phases.

**Date: July 10, 2025**

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  **Refactor `DataValidator` Service:**
    *   **Action:** Split the `DataValidator` class into `src/lib/format-utils.ts` and `src/lib/validation-utils.ts`.
    *   **Action:** Updated components to use the new utility functions and deleted the old service file.
    *   **Outcome:** Improved code organization and maintainability.

2.  **Address `AdvancedExpenseOptions` `userId` Handling:**
    *   **Action:** Refactored the `TagsInput.tsx` dependency to gracefully handle an `undefined` `userId`, removing the `'default_user'` fallback.
    *   **Outcome:** The component is now robust when no user is logged in, preventing errors.

3.  **Implement and Expand `ExpenseService.ts`:**
    *   **Action:** Created `src/services/ExpenseService.ts` with methods for all CRUD operations.
    *   **Action:** Refactored both `EnhancedAddExpenseForm.tsx` and `expense-tracker.tsx` to use the new service for adding, updating, and deleting expenses.
    *   **Outcome:** Fully abstracted expense-related Dexie logic from UI components into a dedicated service layer.

4.  **Implement `VehicleService.ts`:**
    *   **Action:** Created `src/services/VehicleService.ts` with methods for all vehicle CRUD operations.
    *   **Action:** Refactored `VehicleManager.tsx` to use the new service, abstracting its direct Dexie calls.
    *   **Outcome:** Improved separation of concerns for the vehicle management module.

5.  **Summarize `JULES_PROGRESS_LOG.md`:**
    *   **Action:** Condensed older log entries into a summary section to improve readability.

**Summary of Sub-Phase:**
This sub-phase successfully established and applied the service layer pattern for major data modules (Expenses, Vehicles), leading to cleaner components with better separation of concerns. Utility functions were refactored for better code organization, and a minor UI robustness issue related to user authentication state was resolved.
